# jOOQ-Template

This project serves as a template to generate java classes from any existing database scheme using jOOQ. 

Derived projects can easily be used as a dependency for other projects without publicizing the database credentials.

Run `git config include.path ../.gitconfig` to include the template config in your project config.
